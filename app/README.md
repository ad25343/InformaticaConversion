# Informatica Conversion Tool

Converts Informatica PowerCenter XML exports to PySpark, dbt, or Python.

12-step agentic pipeline powered by Claude with a self-improving security knowledge base, actionable remediation guidance, two-pass documentation generation, XML-grounded logic equivalence checking, three human review gates, and batch conversion — submit an entire set of mappings in a single ZIP and run up to 3 concurrently. Every Gate 2 approval makes future conversions smarter.

## Upload Modes

**Individual files** — upload up to three files separately:
- Mapping XML (required)
- Workflow XML (optional — enables session config extraction and $$VAR cross-referencing)
- Parameter file `.txt` or `.param` (optional — resolves all `$$VARIABLE` references)

**ZIP archive** — drop a ZIP containing any combination of the above; file types are auto-detected from XML structure (not filename).

**Batch ZIP** *(v2.0)* — drop a ZIP with one subfolder per mapping; all mappings are converted concurrently (up to 3 at a time). Each mapping runs through the full 12-step pipeline with independent review gates.

```
batch.zip/
  mapping_a/
    mapping.xml       ← required
    workflow.xml      ← optional
    params.txt        ← optional
  mapping_b/
    mapping.xml
```

## Pipeline

| Step | Name | Powered By | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | Session & Parameter Parse | Deterministic | Auto-detect file types; cross-ref validation; $$VAR resolution; credential scan on uploaded XML |
| 1 | Parse XML | lxml (deterministic) | Fails fast on malformed XML; XXE-hardened parser |
| 2 | Classify Complexity | Rule-based | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY_HIGH |
| S2T | Source-to-Target Map | Rule-based | Excel workbook generated |
| 3 | Generate Documentation | Claude | **Tier-based**: LOW mappings use a single pass (overview + transformations + parameters). MEDIUM/HIGH/VERY_HIGH use two passes — Pass 1: transformations; Pass 2: lineage (non-trivial fields only). Pass 2 does not re-send the graph JSON. If truncated, the pipeline continues with a Gate 1 warning — no hard fail. 30-second SSE heartbeats keep UI updated during long runs. |
| 4 | Verify | Deterministic + Claude | Graph structural checks (isolated transforms, disconnected sources/targets) + Claude graph-risk review (hardcoded values, incomplete conditionals, high-risk logic). Does **not** read or check documentation — docs are reviewed visually by the human at Gate 1. |
| **5** | **Gate 1 — Human Review** | UI sign-off | **APPROVE / REJECT** |
| 6 | Stack Assignment | Rules + Claude | PySpark / dbt / Python |
| 7 | Convert | Claude | Production-ready code files + YAML config artifacts. **Security KB injected**: 17 standing rules + auto-learned patterns from prior jobs prepended to every prompt — no wait for the scan to catch known issues |
| **8** | **Security Scan** | bandit + YAML regex + Claude | Hardcoded creds, SQL injection, insecure connections — each finding includes actionable remediation guidance |
| **9** | **Gate 2 — Security Review** | UI sign-off | **APPROVED / ACKNOWLEDGED / REQUEST_FIX / FAILED** — pauses when findings exist; "🔧 How to fix" shown per finding; REQUEST_FIX re-runs Steps 7→8→Gate 2 (max 2 rounds) |
| 10 | Logic Equivalence + Code Quality | Claude | Stage A: rule-by-rule XML→code comparison (VERIFIED/NEEDS_REVIEW/MISMATCH); Stage B: 10+ static quality checks |
| 11 | Test Generation | Claude | pytest / dbt test stubs; test files re-scanned for secrets |
| **12** | **Gate 3 — Code Review** | UI sign-off | **APPROVED / REJECTED** |

### Human Gates

**Gate 1 (Step 5 — Human Review):** Reviewer sees the full Verification Report before any code is generated. Where Claude suggests an actionable code-level fix for a flag (`auto_fix_suggestion`), a "🔧 Suggested Auto-Fix" panel is shown with a checkbox — checking it carries the suggestion forward to Step 7 for the conversion agent to apply.
- APPROVE → pipeline continues to stack assignment and code generation
- REJECT → job blocked permanently

**Gate 2 (Step 9 — Security Review):** Reviewer sees the full security scan findings and makes an informed decision. Pipeline pauses only when the scan is not clean (REVIEW_RECOMMENDED or REQUIRES_FIXES). Clean scans auto-proceed.
- APPROVED → proceed to logic equivalence + code quality review (scan was clean, or reviewer confirmed no action needed)
- ACKNOWLEDGED → proceed with a note on record (known risk accepted)
- REQUEST_FIX → re-run Step 7 (code generation) with all findings injected as mandatory fix requirements, then re-run Step 8 (security scan), then re-present Gate 2. Capped at 2 remediation rounds; if the re-scan is clean it auto-proceeds. "Request Fix" button hidden after round 2.
- FAILED → job blocked permanently

**Gate 3 (Step 12 — Code Review):** Reviewer sees converted code, test coverage, and the security report.
- APPROVED → job marked COMPLETE
- REJECTED → job blocked permanently; team re-uploads the mapping to start a fresh job

## Organisation Configuration

Two optional YAML files allow you to tailor the pipeline to your organisation without modifying any code. Both are read at startup via `backend/org_config_loader.py` (LRU-cached) and fall back gracefully to built-in defaults if absent.

**`app/config/org_config.yaml`** — org-level overrides:

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `pattern_signals` | Extra `target_name_contains` / `source_name_contains` substrings that trigger a specific pattern (e.g. mark tables ending in `_HIST` as SCD2) |
| `audit_fields` | Override the DW audit columns injected into every generated target (`DW_INSERT_DT`, `DW_UPDATE_DT`, `DW_SOURCE_SYS`) — rename columns, change expressions, or disable entirely |
| `verification_policy` | Override any `FLAG_META` entry — promote LOW → HIGH, suppress a flag to INFO, or change blocking status |
| `warehouse_credential_overrides` | Add extra env-var names the profiles.yml generator should reference for non-standard warehouses |
| `pipeline_options.skip_steps` | Conditionally skip Step 4 (documentation) or Step 11 (test generation) based on pattern, tier, and confidence |
| `pipeline_options.auto_approve_gates` | Auto-approve Gate 1 / 2 / 3 under specified conditions (CI environments) |
| `parser_options.additional_unsupported_types` | Extend the list of Informatica transformation types that raise an UNSUPPORTED flag |

**`app/config/warehouse_registry.yaml`** — extensible warehouse profiles. Eight warehouses are pre-registered (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks, SQL Server, Azure Synapse, Microsoft Fabric). Add a new entry to support any SQLAlchemy-compatible target — no code changes required.

**`app/prompts/<stack>_system.j2`** — Jinja2 template overrides for the PySpark, dbt, or Python system prompts. Drop a file here to replace the built-in prompt entirely. See `app/prompts/README.md` for authoring guidance.

## Security Architecture

Every file-handling path flows through `backend/security.py`. Key protections:

| Threat | Defence |
|---|---|
| XXE injection | `safe_xml_parser()` — DTD loading and entity resolution disabled on every lxml parse |
| Zip Slip | `safe_zip_extract()` — every entry path resolved relative to virtual root |
| Zip Bomb | `safe_zip_extract()` — total extracted bytes and entry count capped |
| Symlink attacks | Symlink entries in ZIP silently skipped |
| Oversized uploads | `validate_upload_size()` called on every upload stream before processing |
| Credentials in uploaded XML | `scan_xml_for_secrets()` — checks CONNECTION/SESSION attrs at Step 0 |
| Insecure generated code | Step 8 — bandit (Python), YAML regex scan, Claude review (all stacks) |
| Security gate | Step 9 — human reviewer must explicitly approve, acknowledge, or fail findings before code review begins |
| Secrets in generated test code | Step 11 test files re-scanned and merged into Step 8 report before Gate 3 |
| Recurring bad patterns re-introduced | Security KB — 17 standing rules + patterns learned from every prior Gate 2 approval injected into Step 7 prompt; each job makes the next one safer |

---

## Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | QC tokens |
|------|----------|-----------|
| LOW | < 5 transformations | 2 048 |
| MEDIUM | 5–9 transformations | 4 096 |
| HIGH | 10–14 transformations | 6 144 |
| VERY_HIGH | 15+ transformations, or 2+ independent HIGH structural criteria | 8 192 |

**Documentation (Step 3)** uses a tier-based strategy. LOW-tier mappings get a single pass (Overview + Transformations + Parameters — no lineage section needed for simple mappings). MEDIUM/HIGH/VERY_HIGH use two passes: Pass 1 covers Overview + all Transformations + Parameters; Pass 2 covers Field-Level Lineage (non-trivial fields only) + Session Context + Ambiguities. Pass 2 does not re-send the graph JSON — Pass 1 output already contains all transformation detail, cutting Pass 2 input tokens by ~50%. If a pass truncates, the pipeline continues with a Gate 1 warning rather than failing.

---

## Stack Assignment

Step 6 assigns the target stack based on mapping characteristics. The decision is deterministic — reviewers can override at Gate 1.

| Criterion | PySpark | dbt | Python (Pandas) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Complexity tier** | HIGH / VERY_HIGH | LOW / MEDIUM | LOW / MEDIUM |
| **Data volume** | > 50M rows | Any (SQL-bound) | < 1M rows |
| **Source type** | DB, files, streams | DB / warehouse | Files, APIs |
| **Target type** | DB, data lake, files | Data warehouse | Files, APIs, lightweight DB |
| **Transformation types** | Complex joins, multi-aggregations, UDFs | SQL-expressible — filters, joins, SCDs, derived fields | Simple field mapping, API calls, file conversion |
| **SCD support** | SCD1 + SCD2 (merge/upsert) | SCD1 + SCD2 (snapshots) | SCD1 only |
| **Lookup handling** | Broadcast join, dynamic cache | CTE or `ref()` | Dict lookup / merge |
| **Output artifacts** | `.py` + `requirements.txt` + YAML configs | `.sql` models + `schema.yml` + `sources.yml` + macros | `.py` script + `requirements.txt` |
| **Test framework** | pytest + pyspark.testing | dbt tests (schema.yml) | pytest |

**Hybrid:** documented explicitly in the stack assignment record when a mapping has sub-flows that suit different stacks.

---

## Database

SQLite by default (`app/data/jobs.db`). Sufficient for pilots and migrations up to ~200 mappings.

**For migrations above 200 mappings, PostgreSQL is recommended.** At that scale, concurrent batch runs and large state blobs will start producing `SQLITE_BUSY` timeouts under write contention. Switch by setting `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/db/database.py`:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:5432/informatica_conversion"
```

```bash
pip install asyncpg
```

No schema migration is required — `init_db()` creates all tables on first connect.

Job logs are written to `app/logs/jobs/` as newline-delimited JSON.
